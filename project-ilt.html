      <div class="hero">
        In 2015, I led efforts to update the overall new hire program for retail sellers, a multi-week blended program of instructor led and self-paced materials.
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>This effort involved getting rapidly up to speed on a large amount of existing material in tandem with prioritizing a backlog of update needs. Collaboration with the HQ client, delivery leads and field input were key.</p>
        <p>Feedback from Tom Roberts, my design leader at that time:</p>
        <p><i>"Matt inherited the RSC Foundation curriculum update and immediately engaged in rapid needs analysis and update activities. The original designer assigned left the company and this project was significantly behind schedule, but Matt's intensive analysis and update activities brought it back inline in only a couple of months.</p> 
        <p>"Matt was also innovative by recognizing and implementing several key activities without hesitation: <br>
        	- Introduced Skill Competency Mapping to ensure content alignment with Brian Shay's priorities<br>
        	- Redesigned the curriculum content and structure to reduce training time while maintaining time to proficiency."</i><br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="hero">
        In early 2013, I lead a team effort to update Step Ahead curriculum, a multi-day workshop intended to increase retail sellers' competency with wireless devices. 
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>We focused on updating competencies to increase relevance and transfer back to the job. Also, we migrated course materials to tablets, to both increase learners' proficiency on the devices and eliminate costs with printed materials.</p>
