        I led a team in designing and deploying the first paperless classroom training for 40,000 frontline retail employees.

        <p>This one day workshop drove up to 15% increases in product sales and customer satisfaction scores, when comparing employees completing the course to those who did not. Learners enjoyed a mix of activities: hands-on discovery, guided group interactions, and practice sessions with instructor coaching and feedback.</p>

        <p>The project team included <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/matt-yantzi/97/247/a17">Matt Yantzi</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jay-fallon/8/571/b">Jay Fallon</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rich-spohnholz/9/8a0/801">Rich Spohnholz</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/patrick-neff/73/274/343">Patrick Neff</a>, 60+ trainers covering all 50 states, along with executive sponsors and stakeholders from AT&Tâ€™s Marketing, Sales Operations and Emerging Devices organizations.

        <p>We used Adobe tools to design, develop and deliver the content to iPads and Android tablets. As shown in the sample screens below, we also had fun including game-like elements and achievements to increase employee engagement with the material.</p>
